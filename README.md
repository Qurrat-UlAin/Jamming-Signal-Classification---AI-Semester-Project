# Jamming-Signal-Classification---AI-Semester-Project
This is our submission for the semester project of AI. The dataset has been procured from 'https://github.com/AMHD/Jamming-Detection-in-IoT-Wireless-Networks-An-Edge-AI-Based-Approach', through the use of GNU Radio, we produce a handful of signals to test our model.
